                Stepped House is a private residential dwelling built in SW London on a tight
                backland plot. Responding to the strict planning criteria, the house is formed over
                four levels and designed around three walled courtyards. At the centre of the house
                is a pavilion room that ties separate accommodation together and creates the
                transition as the building steps down the site. <br />
                The fa√ßade design creates an identity in contrast to the local vernacular using robust
                materials such as exposed concrete, water struck brick, standing seam zinc and
                heavy oak framing. A contrasting lightweight greyed timber cladding was adopted
                above. </> }
